## Key Changes from Original Roadmap

### Simplified Approach:
- **No Comment System**: Focus on status updates and internal notes
- **Streamlined UI**: Based on your existing Nuxt UI components
- **Existing Models**: Leverage your complete database schema
- **Email-based Communication**: Instead of real-time commenting

### Your Existing Assets Utilized:
- **Database Models**: All your existing models (Users, Feedbacks, Companies, etc.)
- **Migration**: Your complete database structure
- **Frontend Template**: Your "Add User Template" as a base
- **Project Structure**: Both Nuxt and ASP.NET Core projects

### Updated User Flows:
1. **Customer Flow**: Submit → Track Status → Receive Email Notifications
2. **Support Flow**: Review → Update Status → Add Internal Notes → Assign  
3. **Admin Flow**: Manage Users → Companies → Analytics

## Implementation Priority:
**Phase 1-3 (3 weeks)**: Core customer feedback system
**Phase 4-5 (2 weeks)**: Support and admin portals  
**Phase 6-7 (2 weeks)**: Polish and production deployment

This updated roadmap leverages your existing work and follows the simplified approach from your project documentation, focusing on efficient feedback management without complex commenting systems.
